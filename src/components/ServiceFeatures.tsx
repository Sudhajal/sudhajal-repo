          We often trust popular brands because we believe they maintain a
          certain standardâ€”like offering water with a TDS (Total Dissolved
          Solids) of 54 or higher, which many associate with a balanced mineral
          content. You might notice that mineral water at airports is pricier
          than regular bottles, reflecting the perceived value of those
          essential nutrients. Water is more than just a thirst-quencher; it's a
          complex element carrying vital minerals bound to H2O by ionized bonds,
          directly impacting your body's needs. In short, the right TDS balance
          can be the difference between thriving health and potential issues.
